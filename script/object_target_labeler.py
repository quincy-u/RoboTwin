"""Per-frame, per-arm object-target labeler.

Computes which object each robot arm is manipulating at every timestep, with
both `approach` and `linger/release` phases included so that the labels
guarantee at least one OBB target per frame whenever there is *any* engagement
during the demo. The labels are written to the episode HDF5 as:

    object_target/left   shape (T,)  variable-length string ("name" or "")
    object_target/right  shape (T,)  variable-length string ("name" or "")

Empty string means "this arm is not manipulating anything at this frame" —
the consumer (dino-wam dataloader, visualizer) is expected to mask the slot.

Detection rule (matches script/visualize_obb_active.py heuristic):

  1. **Engagement events** per arm: contiguous runs (≥3 frames) where
       gripper_val < OPEN_THRESH AND the nearest tracked object is within
       DIST_THRESH AND that object is moving (xyz delta ≥ MOVE_EPS over
       MOVE_WINDOW frames, OR qpos delta ≥ QPOS_EPS for articulated objects).
     Each event picks the most-frequent nearest object as its target.

  2. **Timeline fill** per arm:
       - frames 0 .. first_event_start-1     → first event's target  (initial approach)
       - during event i                       → event i's target      (active manipulation)
       - frames between events i and i+1      → event i+1's target    (approach to next)
       - frames after last event              → last event's target   (linger / release)
     Arms with zero engagement events keep the empty string label.

This is deliberately a SHARED module — Base_Task.save_obb2d() calls it during
data collection, and script/save_obb2d_all.py uses it to retro-fill labels
into already-collected HDF5s. The dino-wam vjepa2 prep script is the only
external consumer; both pipelines read the same per-frame labels.
